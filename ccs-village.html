        <h1>CCS Village</h1>
        <p>A district-wide PTO or support group for parents of children with special needs</p>

    <p>A district-wide PTO or support group for parents: </p>
    <p>When we attended Cherry Tree Elementary, I remember a sign in the conference room that read: "In God we Trust, everyone else brings data." </p>
    <p>If my memory serves me correctly, it was my first time attending a Case Conference Committee (CCC).  The principal referred to the meeting as the "Friends of [insert child name] meeting" and said they were there to help.</p>
    <p>It can be overwhelming for parents to attend a CCC meeting.  I remember leaving meetings at other schools feeling like the people hated my child and me.  On those days, I would feel overwhelmed and drained.  Some days I felt like a complete failure.  </p>
    <p>I don't want to say that our emotional support program implements ESL to avoid politics.  I do know that these programs teach self-awareness and self-mastery.  Interestingly, this starts in elementary school for the students in these programs and their peers. </p>
    <p>The main problem I had in the early years was the overwhelmingly negative way the IEP goals were written and the negative words utilized in behavior intervention.  For example, the therapist helping us in the community encouraged us to use positive words and phrases in behavior intervention.  </p>
    <p>We remind the child that negative behaviors are an option when we use them in communication.  For example, past therapists have shared phrases with me such as "use your inside voice" and "we use nice hands."</p>
    <p>The people in our case conference were receptive to rewriting the IEP goals using positive words and communicating the same way.  The people in these programs sacrifice a lot and care for our children who need the most support.  </p>
    <p>I support creating a specific type of PTO or support group for parents who will one day receive that thick document entitled "INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION NOTICE OF PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS."  I don't want the newer parents to feel overwhelmed and like a failure like I did.  I would pour my heart into this group and be a support to these parents.</p>

    <p>I would call it “Carmel Village” or “CCS Village” based on my belief that <a href="https://readthereporter.com/carmel-reader-support-our-teachers-support-staff">"it takes a village to raise a child"</a> and that these families can use all the support that they can receive. I would host quarterly or monthly meetings that bring together advocates, special education attorneys, experienced parents, school officials, mental health providers, and others in the community that can form a cross-functional village around these families.

    <p>On Thursday, September 29, 2022, I participated in the Conversations with Candidates series at Hotel Carmichael and presented by the <a href="https://www.ccs.k12.in.us/foundation">Carmel Education Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://carmelclaylibrary.org/foundation">Carmel Public Library Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.onezonechamber.com/">OneZone Chamber of Commerce</a>.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-russell-cp-b64a926b/">Jack Russell</a> was our gracious moderator.</p>

    <p>According to the Indiana Department of Education, <b>the number of special education teachers in Indiana declined by 4% from 2014 to 2021</b>, while <b>the number of students in special education programs grew by 12% during the same period</b>. Our schools are struggling to fill our special education positions. This makes it harder to implement IEPs and provide a proper education for our children. </p>

    <p>I served in our armed forces, including a tour in Iraq. I have more than ten years of experience working with our special education administrators, resource teachers, and support staff. At work, I serve on our well-being committee. I am also part of a group called the “Village.” The Village is an employee-led group for employees who have children with mental health challenges who need a safe place to share experiences and find support.  </p>

    <p>I know from personal experience how difficult it can be to navigate the mental health system.  </p>

    <p>Here is how I would guide or district.</p>

    <p>I would work with our district and community to <b>establish a district-wide mental health support group for families</b>. This support group could host quarterly or monthly meetings that bring together advocates, experienced parents, special education teachers and staff, mental health providers like St. Vincent and ASPIRE, insurance company representatives, Parent Project representatives, and others in the community that can form a cross-functional village around these families.  </p>

    <p>I would name the group “CCS Village” based on my belief that "it takes a village to raise a child" </p>

    <p>I would guide our district to <b>adopt a community approach to mental health and to trust our parents</b>.  Thank you.</p>
